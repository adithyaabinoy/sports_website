              “The Spirit of Sports: The spirit of sports gives each of us who
              participate an opportunity to be creative. Sports knows no sex,
              age, race or religion. Sports gives us all the ability to test
              ourselves mentally, physically and emotionally in a way no other
              aspect of life can. For many of us who struggle with ‘fitting in’
              or our identity – sports gives us our first face of confidence.
              That first bit of confidence can be a gateway to many other
